#library-app

Create a simple working library app where you can add books,
their info, and whether or not you've read them. You will
eventually be able to store them in your account and use it
as a reading list.

Future features:
- Responsiveness for mobile devices
- Cached storage on browser
- Server storage via accounts
- Working update button
